# Rust Logitech Recoil Control script

This script will be premanently undetectable, as it is using logitechs inbuild scripting functions. Logitech wont betray its customers, and rust wont ban logitech mice, because they would loose massive amounts of players.

I have been using this script full blatant for over a year now and decided to sell it at some point.

NOTE: you can still get banned by admins, but that is just for the individual server. YOU WONT EVER GET VAC OR GAME BANNED USING THIS.

# Features

* Full control for all automatic weapons AND ATTACHMENTS

* Key bindings, letting you configure the script controls to your liking

* Hipfire button, letting you hipfire any weapon while still fully controlling it. This is insanely handy close range

* atomic sleep: most scripts are bound by inferior programmer skills resulting in less accurate recoil control

* legit mode: this can be used to make your bullets a little less laser like while still letting you beam

* adjustable fov and sens: you simply set your own sens and fov in the script and the recoil compensation will adjust to your settings
