# Project

This was a customized anti recoil script for the game known as rust.

As of today they changed the recoil to something more manageable, rendering the script needless. 

# Rust_Lua_Generator

The .py files convert values taken directly from the rust game files to ingame vectors for each gun. These then get inserted 
in the respective .lua files which the logitech mouse can process. 

# Overlay

The mouse itself has several buttons to which different guns can be assigned. In order to know at all times what gun currently is 
selected, i coded this overlay.
